# Architecture for Gemini Game Hub

This document outlines the architectural design for the Gemini Game Hub application.

## 1. Technology Stack

Here is the proposed technology stack for the application:

| Category | Technology | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | [React](https://react.dev/) | A popular and powerful library for building user interfaces. |
| **Backend** | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) | A fast and scalable environment for building web applications. |
| **Database** | [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) | A flexible and scalable NoSQL database. |
## 2. Database Schema

The database will use the following collections:

-   **Users**: Stores user information.
-   **Games**: Stores information about the generated games.

Here is a description of each collection:

### Users Collection

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `_id` | ObjectId | Unique identifier for the user. |
| `username` | String | The user's username. |
| `email` | String | The user's email address. |
| `password` | String | The user's hashed password. |
| `createdAt` | Date | The date the user was created. |

### Games Collection

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `_id` | ObjectId | Unique identifier for the game. |
| `name` | String | The name of the game. |
| `description` | String | A description of the game. |
| `code` | String | The code for the game. |
| `createdBy` | ObjectId | The user who created the game. |
| `published` | Boolean | Whether the game is published. |
| `createdAt` | Date | The date the game was created. |
| `updatedAt` | Date | The date the game was last updated. |
## 3. API Endpoint Design

The following API endpoints will be available:

### Users

-   `POST /api/users/register`: Register a new user.
-   `POST /api/users/login`: Log in a user.

### Games

-   `POST /api/games`: Create a new game.
-   `GET /api/games`: Get a list of all games.
-   `GET /api/games/:id`: Get a single game by its ID.
-   `PUT /api/games/:id`: Update a game.
-   `DELETE /api/games/:id`: Delete a game.
## 4. Deployment Strategy

The application will be deployed using the following strategy:

-   **Frontend**: The frontend will be deployed to a static hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.
-   **Backend**: The backend will be deployed to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
-   **Database**: The database will be deployed to a cloud database service like MongoDB Atlas.
## 5. Workflow

Here is a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the workflow of the application:

```
